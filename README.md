# Overview

I created this interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game to explore graphics programming, user interface design, and audio synthesis. This project challenged me to learn new libraries, implement animations, and create an engaging user experience.

This is a classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring a graphical interface with animated game pieces and sound effects. The game includes visual feedback with animated pieces that slide into position and grow when placed. The restart button allows players to start a new game.

My purpose for writing this software was to deepen my understanding of game development fundamentals, including graphics rendering, event handling, animation systems, and audio programming.


# Development Environment

I developed this game using Visual Studio Code with Python 3.13.5. The game is written in Python and uses the Pygame library for graphics rendering, event handling, and audio systems. I also used NumPy for audio synthesis to create custom sound effects.
